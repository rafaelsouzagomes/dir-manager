Personal Finance Guide

1. Budgeting:

Create a budget to track your income and expenses. List all sources of income and categorize your expenses (such as housing, groceries, utilities, entertainment, etc.). Compare your income and expenses to ensure you're living within your means.

2. Savings:

Emergency Fund: Set aside 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible account as a safety net.
Short-Term Goals: Save for upcoming expenses like vacations, weddings, or a new car.
Long-Term Goals: Start saving early for major life goals like buying a home, funding education, or retirement.
