Vanilla Sponge Cake

Ingredients:

1 and ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 and ½ teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
½ cup whole milk
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together using a hand mixer or a stand mixer until light and fluffy.

Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is well incorporated.

Mix in the vanilla extract.
